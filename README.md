***Rules:*** 

The block stacker game is a classic arcade game where the goal is to stack a set of blocks to reach the top. As long as one block reaches the top, the user wins. 

How it Works:

The blocks are set on a grid and begin at the base starting with three. As the user begins the set of blocks will begin to moving left-to-right, bouncing in the opposite direction once they reach the end of the grid. The user's goal is to time the set of blocks perfectly, so that the blocks line up on top of the next set of blocks. If the user misses, the blocks fall to the bottom row and disappear. If none of the blocks stack on top of the previous blocks, the game is over and the user must restart. 

***User Walkthrough:***

- 1. Load the page

- 2. Choose where to begin your base by clicking the "STOP" button at the correct time (TIP: Try and line up the blocks against wall or end of the row to make it easier)

- 3. Line up the next row of blocks on top of the previous set. Try and get all blocks on to the next row. 

    **If you miss any, they fall and disappear! Try and maintain all your blocks as you make your way up!

- 4. Each row gets faster as you move up, continue to stop on time!

- 5. After reaching the top, a victory message will appear.

- 6. User must reload the page in order to play again.

***Next Steps***

- Since Blockstacker is not what I set out for it to be I have two options, continue on the point and click path and created a Connect Four or MineSweeper game as a side project or continue with BlockStacker! and finishing what I set out to create. I'm leaning more towards the latter, but we'll see. 

***BlockStacker!***

- Going down the BlockStacker! route, I had the idea to implement a leaderboard where I users could input their initials to show their high school which would be recorded underneath the Stop button as you scroll down. 
- Another feature I considered was implementing a difficulty settings, so 'Easy' , 'Medium' , and 'Hard' modes that the user could choose upon loading the webpage. I would do this by implementing a modal. 

***Connect Four***

- Going down the Connect Four route, I would change the grid to reflect a 6x7 grid and make it so when four 'cells' are filled in there is a winner. 
- I would also implement turns for each player so nobody could do two moves in a row.
- Upon winning, the user would no longer be able to click on the grid and a play again button would appear at the bottom.
