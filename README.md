# CodeStacker Game!

***Rules:*** 

The block stacker game is a classic arcade game where the goal is to stack a set of blocks to reach the top. As long as one block reaches the top, the user wins. 

How it Works:

The blocks are set on a grid and begin at the base starting with three. As the user begins the set of blocks will begin to moving left-to-right, bouncing in the opposite direction once they reach the end of the grid. The user's goal is to time the set of blocks perfectly, so that the blocks line up on top of the next set of blocks. If the user misses, the blocks fall to the bottom row and disappear. If none of the blocks stack on top of the previous blocks, the game is over and the user must restart. 

***User Walkthrough:***
